        "This was my first project. I kept the methods as I originally implemented them, without improving them after gaining more experience, because I wanted to compare my progress across each project.",

        "This was my second project. I gained some experience from my first project, understood a bit more about React, and decided to learn about REST APIs and React Query.",

      description:
        "This was my third project. I decided to make a copy of the Animista website to learn more about React hooks, understand animations, and explore more optimization and organization techniques. So far, this has been my best project, where I can showcase my current experience with these tools. I chose to build it without any libraries to understand the fundamentals of each new method I usedâ€”so that later, I could use libraries more effectively. For example, in this portfolio, I am using libraries.",
